1. Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
    Class components enable me to use react lifecycle method in some old code at work.

2. Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
    Constructor() is used to initialize local state and bind event handlers.
    ComponentDidMount() is used to load data from API.
    Render() is required for using react component subclass. It returns what I need when called.

3. What is the purpose of a custom hook?
    Custom hook is for coding reusable functions, event handlers, and methods.

4. Why is it important to test our apps?
    Testing ensures the app work properly for the users.
